# Home-Automation
The project presents a home automation system with time-critical tasks, shared resources, and, data visualization over the cloud. Since it is difficult to execute the tasks in a sequential and regular system, this home automation system makes use of a Real-Time Operating System to perform the tasks with precision and reliability.

This project focuses on the responsiveness and reliability of the system using FreeRTOS, RTOS kernel. The system makes use of several sensors to monitor the environment, and a few output devices to display or alert the people. The system will also uses an IoT platform to visualize the live data in the cloud platform.
